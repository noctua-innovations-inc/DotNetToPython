 * Initial .NET-to-Python communications were implemented using gRPC. However, the need
 * to increase the default communication timeout and the desire to implement Retrieval-Augmented
 * Generation (RAG) suggest that communications would be better served using a Message Queue Pattern.
 * 
 * Key Considerations:
 * - gRPC's default timeout may not be sufficient for long-running operations.
 * - Message queues provide better support for asynchronous, decoupled communication.
 * - RAG workflows often involve batch processing and event-driven architectures, which align well with message queues.
